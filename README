project PictureFilter

customFilters/UnwrapFilter.swift — CIWarpFilter that unwraps input image to equirectangular format

PictureFilter-Bridging-Header.h — bridging header to include the Objective-C CVWrapper header
UIImage+OpenCV.h — header for the Objective-C UIImage <-> CVMat method declarations
UIImage+OpenCV.mm — contains Objective-C implementations for UIImage <-> CVMat methods
CVWrapper.h — header for the Objective-C OpenCV wrapper, containing declaration for the drawImageCircle method
CVWrapper.mm — contains Objective-C implementation of drawImageCircle method
circles.h — C++ header containing the computeImageCircle method declaration
circles.cpp — contains the C++ implementation for the computeImageCircle method

ViewController.swift — a view controller that starts with an unwrapped image; when touched (via button), the UnwrapFilter is applied and the output is displayed. Also contains deprecated code that saves a generated WrapMap using NSCoding.
GLViewController.swift — view controller for the capture functions, using AVFoundation and AVAssetWriter


WrapMap.swift — generate an image whose pixels contain the CI warp filter coordinates
CameraController.swift — demonstrates how to initialize and configure an AVFoundation session 


Viewing
-Image/video picker
-GVR viewer
-fb-like viewer?

Shooting
-calibration with video shading 
-photo/video mode
-unwrapping and drawing crop to screen
-recording


small tasks:
(x) update unwrap filter
(x) make calibrate filter
(x) insert calibration text and button (store every 30th frame; call circles fn; switch view — sessionQueue.async(execute:)
(x) insert photo/video slider
(x) get photo/video asset writer working

( ) full screen button in collection view cell
( ) refreshing collection view after shooting
( ) delete 360 media
( ) saving movies to 360 album
( ) clean up filming UI (mostly timer)
( ) displaying movies in collection view
( ) clean up UI — Ryan
( ) use Metal to apply filters (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/CoreImaging/ci_tasks/ci_tasks.html)
( ) crop unwrapped video for preview

***enable bitcode no (build settings -> search bitcode)
